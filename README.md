<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Bhanuja (Chinni) 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">System-thinker | Backend Dev | Infra Explorer</h3>

💡 I’m that engineer who’s curious about **how things scale**, how services talk to each other, and what happens when everything fails and still recovers.

🛠️ I build backend systems, automation pipelines, and tools that talk to APIs, sensors, or each other. I'm currently crafting mini-systems to learn **distributed computing, DevOps, and observability** — while keeping it creative.

### 🧪 What I'm Exploring
- ⏳ Distributed Job Queues & Event-Driven Architectures
- 🛠 Building CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions & Docker
- 📊 Real-time Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- ☁️ Cloud deployments via AWS/DigitalOcean
- 🐘 My favorite personal project: An IoT system to protect elephants 🐘
